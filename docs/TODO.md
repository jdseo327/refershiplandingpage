## Bug Tracker

This section tracks bugs and issues that have been identified but temporarily set aside. Each entry includes:

- File location
- Description of the issue
- Potential solutions or workarounds
- Priority level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

When a bug is encountered that can't be immediately fixed:

1. Add a `// TODO: [Bug Description]` comment in the code
2. Add an entry to this Bug Tracker section
3. Revisit and prioritize these issues regularly

For persistent bugs (after 5+ fix attempts), include additional information:

- Summary of all previous fix attempts and why they failed
- Analysis of potential upstream issues or architectural problems
- Detailed recommended course of action with rationale
- Consider marking as "Requires Investigation" if the root cause remains unclear

Example format:

```
1. **[Component Name] - [Brief Issue Description]** (Priority: [Level])
   - File: src/path/to/file.tsx
   - Issue: Detailed description of the problem
   - Potential solutions: Ideas for fixing
   - Added: YYYY-MM-DD

   For persistent bugs, also include:
   - Previous attempts: List of approaches tried and outcomes
   - Root cause analysis: Deeper investigation into the source
   - Recommended action: Specific next steps with justification
```

1. **Hero Form - Mobile Button Width** (Priority: Medium)

   - File: src/app/page.tsx (around line 206)
   - Issue: The button in the hero form doesn't display full width on mobile despite having identical structure to the waitlist form below
   - Potential solutions:
     - Check parent container differences
     - Investigate CSS inheritance issues
     - Compare with waitlist form implementation
   - Added: 2023-11-15

2. **Hero Subtitle - Line Breaks** (Priority: Low)
   - File: src/app/page.tsx (around line 184)
   - Issue: Line breaks on small screens need improvement

     "What if finding strategic partners was"
     "as simple as"
     "knowing who already wants to work"
     "with you?"
     ```
   - Desired breaks:
     ```
     "What if finding strategic partners"
     "was as simple as knowing who already"
     "wants to work with you?"
     ```
